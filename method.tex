\section{Method/Ellipse Detector}
In this section, what we indroduce is an ellipse detection method with probability control and based on the co-clustering scheme. The whole picture
comprises mainly: (1) Arc-segment Detection; (2) Generation of Candiates Field; (3) Correlation (4) Co-clustering and (5) Validation. Details are elaborated upon in the following sections.

\subsection{Arc-segment Detection}
Most arc, but most canny\cite{kim2002fast,dong2018accurate}.
